# music_theory_lab.py
A script to experiment around with music theory concepts.

If you have no idea what notes, octaves, chords or scales mean, I highly recommend you run the tutorial mode (sensei mode) as explained in the usage examples below.

## :warning: Caution

If you want to play with the underlying wave frequency settings by manually editing the script, please **be careful not to damage your ears (or your speakers)** by extreme frequencies and high volumes.

As a general rule, please make sure the volume is low when experimenting around.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup/ Preparation
```bash
pipenv install --ignore-pipfile --python 3.7
pipenv shell
```

Self teaching myself music theory (still learning though) would not have been possible without the excellent content on https://yourguitaracademy.com/courses
